# Custom Swiper with Swiper

A custom Swiper with arrows functionality (left and right) and icons on top of Swiper
. Left and right arrows are used to navigate back and forth.
The icons on the top are linked with an image, when we press one of them it should send us to that specific
image. On mobile we have some small changes, instead of using arrows we will use left and
right swipe and the icons section should be a horizontal scroll
